      "description": "About Pilot\n\nPilot is an online health platform that makes it easy and safe for Australian men to get access to the prescriptions, products, and medical advice they need for the issues they find hard to talk about. Since launching in 2019, we’ve become one of the fastest-growing telehealth brands in Australia, growing to over 50,000 patients.\n\nOur mission is to enable more men to get help for the conditions that affect their day-to-day lives. We know men are a notoriously hard-to-reach group who are less inclined to talk about their healthcare needs, and we want to help eliminate that hesitancy.\n\nWe started out helping men get fast and discreet help for their sexual health needs. We've quickly expanded to other conditions that affect men — hair loss, trouble sleeping, skincare, and obesity.\n\nSo how does Pilot work?\n\nWe've built a technology platform to deliver healthcare to men with a level of care and depth that brings healthcare into the internet age. We provide an easy-to-use... interface for men to get help, for doctors to manage their consultations via telehealth, and for pharmacies to fulfill any prescriptions, streamlining the user experience from the patient's and doctor's points of view.\n\nThis is done by automating the collection of most of the information a doctor needs in a consultation, providing this information in an easy format to doctors so they can make a decision on treatment, and making sure their time is used effectively.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nWe're currently looking for passionate GPs to join in our goal of making healthcare for men accessible, convenient and safe. Join Pilot in providing men with an online medical support network of qualified specialists like yourself.\n\nYour responsibilities:\n• Through telehealth, conduct asynchronous text-based consultations with patients, including assessing, screening, diagnosing, and prescribing medication for patients as necessary\n• Adhere to Pilot's platform guidelines and policies and complete all required training\n• Provide an exceptional clinical experience for patients through the delivery of prompt and empathetic care on the platform\n\nEssentials:\n• Australian Citizen / Australian Permanent Resident / Temporary Resident\n• Post-graduate year 4+, with full general or specialist AHPRA registration and full General Registration with the Medical Board of Australia\n• Valid medical indemnity insurance\n• Skilled at using technology to deliver care and communicate with patients\n• Empathetic, friendly, and approachable\n\nBenefits:\n• Work from the comfort of your home\n• Support from our telehealth customer experience team, medical directors, and GP community\n• Payment on a per consult basis\n• Use telehealth to provide inclusive, empathetic, and non-stigmatised care and vastly improve the patient experience",

In fact, the city has more restaurants and hotels per capita than any other regional centre in Western Australia, and plays host to many of the region’s biggest events.\n\nArt comes naturally to the many locals who live and work in the community. Photography, painting, drawing and sculpture are showcased at retail outlets, exhibitions and competitions throughout the region.\n\nThe Goldfields Arts Centre, located in the centre of town, is the premier entertainment venue in the Goldfields. It has a wide range of state-of-the-art facilities, including a 700-seat theatre, and an A-class gallery, which stages many quality exhibitions throughout the year.\n\nHow Head Medical can help…\n\nArranging a position overseas is very exciting, but we understand that it can also be daunting and time consuming. We’re the UK's specialist in international medical recruitment and we‘ve helped many Doctors relocate since we first started out in 2008 (you can read what people have said about working with us on our testimonials page). We know it’s important to balance career opportunities with lifestyle and we’ll talk through your plans and will get to know you to make sure we find the right role in the right location.\n\nOnce we have secured a job for you, we’ll manage the Medical Registration and Visa application process, and support you (and your family) with the relocation itself",
